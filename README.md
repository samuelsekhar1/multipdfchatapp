## üìù Description
The Multi-PDF's Chat App is a Streamlit-based web application designed to facilitate interactive conversations with a chatbot. The app allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, extract text information from them, and train a chatbot using this extracted content. Users can then engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot.

The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

1. **PDF Loading** : The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.

2. **Text Chunking** : The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

3. **Language Model** : The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.

4. **Similarity Matching** : When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

5. **Response Generation** : The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDFs.
